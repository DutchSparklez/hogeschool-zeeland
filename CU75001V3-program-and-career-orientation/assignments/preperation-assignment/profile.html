        <h1>Profile</h1>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Wesley van Schaijk, 24 years old, starting a new study in September 2022.
            I live in the Netherlands, in the province of Zuid-Holland.
            In my spare time, I like to play games, go hiking, and read books.
            My favorite game is Pok√©mon, my favorite book is Hunter's Apprentice.
        </p>

        <h2>Study Choice</h2>
        <p>
            In 2016,
            I started studying computer science at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
            Due to personal reasons, I eventually had to drop out.
            Now that everything is back in order,
            I want to start again with a similar program at another school.
            I'm not sure if I want to do a masters or get a job after my studies.
            Data Science is highly preferred, as is software architecture.
            I like to think at both high and low levels.
            I hope to get a nice balance in this during the training.
        </p>

        <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>
            Fast learning, social, organised, creating challenges.
            When I get a topic, I start to delve into it and get to the bottom of everything.
        </p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            Too helpful, low confidence in own work.
            I like to help people, that was my job at RUAS,
            but I often forget my own work, because I quickly see it as less important.
        </p>

        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            Group dynamics.
            At the RUAS I had not made an arrangement with my job that partly caused my drop out,
            now I want to do things differently.
        </p>

        <h3>Threats</h3>
        <p>
            Working overtime, not being able to say no.
            See weaknesses and when people ask me to do something,
            the answer is automatically yes, whether I have time or not.
